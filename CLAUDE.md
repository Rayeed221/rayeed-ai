# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**DroneAI (RayeedAI — রাইদ-এআই)** is a voice-controlled autonomous drone assistant using Python and the Google Gemini Live API. It accepts natural language voice commands in **Bangla** and translates them into drone flight operations. The system runs entirely async and supports a simulated drone backend (default) or real drone hardware via MAVLink.

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with simulated drone (default)
python app.py

# Run with real drone via MAVLink
DRONE_BACKEND=mavlink MAVLINK_URI=udp:192.168.1.10:14550 python app.py

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run a single test file
pytest tests/test_state_machine.py -v

# Run tests with async support
pytest tests/test_failures.py -v
```

## Architecture

The system is a **five-layer pipeline**:

```
Voice Input → Gemini Live API → Planner → Tool Dispatcher → Drone Adapter
```

### Layer Responsibilities

1. **Audio Interface** (`audio/`) — Mic capture → PCM → Gemini; speaker playback. `turn_manager.py` mutes mic while AI is speaking.

2. **LLM Orchestration** (`app.py` + `tools/declarations.py`) — Manages the Gemini Live session, system prompt (Bangla), function declarations, and the resilient receive loop. Session tasks (mic, send, receive, playback) are isolated from background tasks (telemetry, battery, position) so a crash in one doesn't kill the other.

3. **Mission Planning** (`planner.py` + `workflows/`) — Decision engine with 6 outcomes: `CONTINUE`, `WAIT`, `RETRY`, `REPLAN`, `ABORT`, `FAILSAFE`. The planner has **authority to override LLM decisions** for safety. Non-blocking waits allow audio/telemetry to continue during motor spin-up or altitude stabilization.

4. **Safe Execution** (`tool_dispatcher.py` + `safety_policy.py` + `state_machine.py`) — 7-step pipeline: registry check → safety pre-check → execute (10s timeout) → state transition → update monitors → reset retry counter → return `ToolResponse`. Safety gates block operations on low battery, stale telemetry, altitude/speed violations, or exceeded retry counts.

5. **Drone Backend** (`adapters/`) — Swappable via `DRONE_BACKEND` env var. `SimAdapter` (default) simulates all operations in memory. `MAVLinkAdapter` connects to real hardware.

### Key Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `app.py` | Entry point; `DroneAI` class; Gemini Live session management |
| `state_machine.py` | Mission states (IDLE→CONNECTED→ARMED→TAKEOFF→ENROUTE→HOVER→LANDING→RTL→FAILSAFE) and legal transition graph |
| `tool_dispatcher.py` | Central 7-step execution pipeline for all drone commands |
| `safety_policy.py` | Pre-execution gates: battery, telemetry freshness, altitude ceiling, speed, retry limits |
| `planner.py` | Decision engine; overrides LLM `next_action`; schedules non-blocking waits |
| `tool_registry.py` | Metadata for 25+ tools: description, arg schema, permission level, allowed states |
| `schemas.py` | `ToolResponse` envelope (ok, tool, state, data, error, next_action, wait, confidence, timestamp) |
| `config.py` | All thresholds and env vars (API key, audio rates, backend, safety limits) |

### Tool Execution Flow

Every drone command goes through `tool_dispatcher.py`:
1. Registry check (tool exists?)
2. Safety pre-check (battery ≥15%, telemetry fresh <5s, altitude <120m, speed <15 m/s, retries <3)
3. Execute via adapter (10s timeout)
4. State machine transition
5. Update safety monitors
6. Reset retry counter on success
7. Return normalized `ToolResponse`

### State Machine Rules

- `force_failsafe()` is always allowed from any state
- Tools declare which states they are valid in (e.g., `takeoff` only in `ARMED`)
- `is_airborne()` covers TAKEOFF, ENROUTE, HOVER, LANDING, RTL

### Backend Abstraction

Both adapters implement the same interface from `adapters/base_adapter.py`. Switching between sim and MAVLink requires only an env var change — no code changes.

## Configuration (`config.py`)

Key env vars:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Gemini API key
- `DRONE_BACKEND` — `"sim"` (default) or `"mavlink"`
- `MAVLINK_URI` — MAVLink connection string (default: `udp:127.0.0.1:14550`)

Safety thresholds (all configurable):
- Battery critical: 15% → failsafe; Battery low: 25% → warn
- Altitude ceiling: 120m
- Max speed: 15 m/s
- Telemetry stale: 5s → wait; 10s → emergency failsafe
- Max retries: 3

## Testing

Framework: `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio`. All test files are in `tests/`. Each major subsystem has its own test file covering normal paths, error/retry paths, and state transitions.
